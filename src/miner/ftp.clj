;; Apache Commons Net API:
;; http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/javadocs/api-3.3/index.html

;; Uses Apache Commons Net 3.3.  Does not support SFTP, but does support FTPS.

;; FTP is considered insecure.  Data and passwords are sent in the
;; clear so someone could sniff packets on your network and discover
;; your password.  Nevertheless, FTP access is useful for dealing with anonymous
;; FTP servers and situations where security is not an issue.
